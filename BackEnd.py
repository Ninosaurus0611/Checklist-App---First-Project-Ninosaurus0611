#Changes to make to go from: To do list -> Checklist
# Dont use input() -> apps frontend will give the data
# Turn your functions into methods that accept parameters (like add_task(task)) instead of asking for input
# Store the tasks permanently (save to JSON file) - because when you close the app, your list would otherwise disappear
# Return data - not print() everywhere - so the frontend (Kivy GUI) can display it nicely
